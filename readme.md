# Boutique Advisory Platform – README.md

This document provides a complete technical and functional instruction set for building the **Boutique Advisory Platform**, a multi-tenant, workflow-automated, and multilingual (Khmer, English, Chinese) system that connects SMEs with investors, supported by boutique advisory services. It is structured so **Cursor AI** can execute the development directly.

## 📌 Project Overview
**Boutique Advisory** combines:
- **Advisory services** (investment readiness, governance, compliance support).
- **Digital platform** (deal room, investor dashboard, matchmaking engine).
- **Ongoing post-funding support** (reporting, governance, risk management).

The platform must support:
- **Multi-tenancy**: separate organizations with isolated data, branding, and user management.
- **Workflow automation**: automated SME certification, investor onboarding, deal workflows.
- **Multi-language support**: Khmer, English, and Chinese across all interfaces.

- **ORM:** Prisma or Sequelize.
- **File Storage:** AWS S3 for SME docs.
- **Authentication:** JWT/OAuth2. Future: DID integration (VaultID).
- **Workflow Automation:** Temporal.io or Camunda.
- **KYC/AML:** Third-party API integration (e.g., Onfido, Sumsub).
- **Blockchain:** Optional (Ethereum/Polygon/Hyperledger) for immutable records.

### High-Level Modules

## 🛠️ Development Instructions (Cursor AI)

### 1. Initialize Project
```bash
npx create-next-app boutique-advisory-frontend
mkdir boutique-advisory-backend && cd boutique-advisory-backend && npm init -y
```

### 2. Backend Setup
- Use Express with modular routes: `/auth`, `/sme`, `/investors`, `/deals`, `/funding`, `/tenant`, `/workflow`, `/admin`.
- Add tenant-aware middleware: extract `tenant_id` from JWT or request header.
- Connect PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM.
- Implement KYC mock service first, then plug into Onfido API.

### 3. Frontend Setup
- Use Next.js + TailwindCSS.
- Add `react-i18next` for multi-language support.
- Pages: `/login`, `/register`, `/dashboard`, `/smes`, `/investors`, `/dealroom`.
- Components: SMECard, InvestorCard, DealRoomList, AdvisorDashboard.

### 4. Workflow Automation
- Integrate Temporal.io.
- Define workflows: SME certification, investor onboarding, deal approval.
- Automate reminders and status updates.

### 5. File Uploads
- Integrate AWS S3 SDK.
- SMEs upload pitch decks, financials.
- Store S3 URLs in PostgreSQL.

### 6. Matchmaking Engine
- Rule-based filter: match SME sector/stage to investor preferences.
- Later add ML model for scoring.

### 7. Post-Funding Reporting
- Create reporting microservice.
- Investor dashboard with SME KPIs (quarterly).

### 8. Internationalization
- Create `/locales/en.json`, `/locales/km.json`, `/locales/zh.json`.
- Implement language switcher on frontend.
- Translate all UI strings, notifications, and reports.

### 9. Multi-Tenancy
- Ensure all tables include `tenant_id`.
- Tenant isolation in queries.
- Admin UI for tenant onboarding, branding, and language default.

### 10. Blockchain Integration (Optional Future)
- Smart contract to log deals (deal_id, amount, parties).
- Explorer view for transparency.

## 📎 Notes for Developers
- Enforce **multi-tenant isolation** in all database queries.
- Design workflows as reusable components.
- Build i18n into the system from day one.
- Use modular microservices so additional features (VaultID, blockchain) can be integrated later.
